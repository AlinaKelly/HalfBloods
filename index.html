			<strong>Chapter 1 - The Hunt</strong>

			Tiger crept through the long grass, eyes fixed on the deer, she clutched her staff in her right hand;

			in one quick movement she threw her staff, it flew through the air gracefully, it's sharp tip piercing the deer's skin straight through the heart making it a quick and painful death, Tiger walked over to the deer and hoisted it over her shoulders after extracting her staff, she trekked back through the white forest, the pure white leaves falling around her as a warm breeze blew her slick wavy orange hair back, as she walked she reflected back on what her mentor, Mariel, Queen of Elves had taught her in the few years she had stayed at the elf Kingdom, Mariel had told Tiger she was special, the first halfblood to be born in this universe, Mariel had taught her how to use her gifted weapon an ivory bo staff, and how to harness the powers of ice and snow, her element, Mariel also told her that soon another halfblood would be born, she didn't know when or where but soon, and sure enough Fox, the second halfblood was born, from fire. She was taught that each halfblood came from and element in Tiger's case it was ice and snow, and that each one was half animal, named after their animal, each halfblood can turn into their animal and in human form that have their animals ears and tail, she was told to conceal these in public, Tiger marvelled now at how much she and Fox had progressed before Cat came along from lightning, Fox had mastered the art of healing whilst Tiger had become a greater warrior than the best elf soldier, and Cat has nearly mastered karate as well as using her gifted weapon a silver katana and Fox's gifted weapon is two golden daggers sheathed at her waist, all of a sudden Tiger was knocked out of her thoughts by something on her back, it bowled her over, Tiger instinctively stood up throwing it off her back, she wheeled and held her staff up ready to bring it down on her attacker but as she looked down she saw the smiling face of a little girl, she immediately recognised her "Cat!" She said "What are you doing here?" Tiger asked.

		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:20px; text-align:left">
			"I followed you" Cat answered, brushing her strait black hair back, it fell just below her shoulders. "I told you to stay with Fox" Tiger scolded, Cat's smile fell, seeing this Tiger immediately said "You did well on sneaking up on me though you caught me off guard," Cat's smile returned, Tiger held her hand out and helped Cat to her feet, Cat pulled her black cloak's hood over her head concealing her cat ears, the cape on her cloak concealed her tail and underneath her cloak she wore a silk dress.

			When Tiger and Cat arrived back at their camp Fox was sitting by the fire fiddling with her herbs for her healing remedies, Fox looked up as they approached and smiled she patted the dirt next to her as a gesture to sit down and Cat went over and sat next to her, Fox reached in to the fire and pulled out a shining rock and gave it to Tiger, as Tiger touched it she felt a surge of energy, Tiger inspected it and realised it was a moonstone, Tiger's birthstone "You remembered" Tiger said softly.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:20px; text-align:left">
			"How could I forget your birthday?" Fox said, smiling up at her "Put it near your heart, that is where you will get the most power from it" Fox said.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:20px; text-align:left">
			"I know" said Tiger tucking it in her white leather jumpsuit near her heart, Tiger then sat down near Fox a bit further away from the fire; because her element is ice and snow she is affected by heat unlike Fox who is immune to it, Cat is lightning which is hot so she isn't affected but she can't harness its powers, the three of them where trained by the best so they know what to keep away from and what they aren't affected by. After sitting for a while they all rolled out their beds and went to sleep.

			Tiger was woken by an unknown presence, she couldn't see it or hear or even smell it but she sensed it, she could tell it wasn't Fox or Cat and it wasn't just a wild animal that had come to scavenge for food, she stared up at the full moon, wait; full moon? Tiger cursed in her head "How could I forget!" She thought to herself, full moon = werewolves! Tiger sprang into action, thinking up a plan "That's it!" She thought, she remembered what Mariel had taught her, without a sound she shifted into her tigress form, she snarled, alerting the werewolf, it turned around, its green eyes glowing in the dark. It snarled back at her, in the corner of her eye she saw Fox and Cat get up on the other side of the clearing but the werewolf saw them too, it turned its back to face them. Tiger took her chance and lunged at the werewolf sinking her teeth into its unprotected back, it yowled in pain as it tried to fling Tiger off but she only bit deeper into its skin, all of a sudden Cat took a running jump and kicked the werewolf squarely between the eyes killing it, Tiger shifted back to human form and looked at Cat in shock, then she grinned; Cat had finally found her inner strength.
